# Open-Primorsky-Krai
Dive into the rich natural and cultural world of the Russian Far East with an interactive drawing experience. This open-source app blends creativity and learning, offering users a hands-on way to explore the landscapes, wildlife, and heritage of Primorsky Krai.

As you draw, you’ll connect with real elements of the region: the majestic Amur tiger, the rare Ussuri leopard, marine species from the Sea of Japan, traditional motifs of Indigenous communities, and the distinctive architecture of Far Eastern towns. Each illustration comes with brief, educational context—turning art into a quiet moment of discovery.

Built for students, teachers, digital artists, and cultural explorers, the app supports offline use and features beginner-friendly tools. It’s designed not just for creative expression, but as a gentle introduction to krai studies and regional biodiversity.

The project is open to collaboration. We especially encourage input from educators, ethnographers, wildlife illustrators, and edtech developers who care about preserving local knowledge through engaging digital formats.

All code, visual assets, UX notes, and educational metadata are included in this repository.
